# SaveImageBot
This is code for a discord bot I made for a server that saves image attachments.
Using the command '!save', the bot will download all image attachments from the text channel where the command was called from.

All python code was written in VS Code.

I based my code off of this video, but instead of saving an image the user sends, it saves all previous images found in the text channel
